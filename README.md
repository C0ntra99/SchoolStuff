### SchoolStuff
Just a repo for different programs I write for classes
## 1. ResolvIP
Python program written to generate a list of hostnames and get the IP addresses for those hostnames
- Written for a class demo, needed to get the IP addresses of all the lab computers in a classroom
## 2. OphCrack
Python program written to parsh a file for hashes and then pass those hashes to ophrack
- Written for a class assignment, did not want to manually pass ophcrack 50+ hashes 
  - *still need to upload*
